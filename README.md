# HTADs

A constrained hierarchical method to detect Topologically Associated Domains

## Getting Started

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
# Load packages.

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running algorithm

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Dependencies

```
require(data.table)
require(dryhic) --> NO HO TINC CLAR (soles es per a la symmetrix matrix)
require(Matrix)
require(doParallel)
require(rioja)
require(fpc)
require(reshape2)
```

### Format of input data:
We highly recommended normalize the data before to start the TAD caller. We give advice to use ONED normalization to correct the experimental bias that affects the signal profile defined by the contacts.

 - 3 columns-format stored in tab-separated value without header. The first and the second columns correspond to the pair of loci(i,j) which are stablish a average number of normalized interactions (the last column).

```
### Visualization of the data and Pearson correlation matrix

### PCA (200) + Why 200?
